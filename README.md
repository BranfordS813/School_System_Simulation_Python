# School System Simulation (Python)

An exercise in creating a simple school system interactive simulation where information is inputted for students, teachers, and other school faculty. Functions focus on appropriate topics like assigning grades and making grade books for teachers, and reading grades by students.

## Features
- Basic entities: students, teachers, faculty
- Gradebook management and grade assignment
- Student-grade lookup
- Simple, text-based interactions

## Project Structure
- Core modules live as standalone `.py` files (e.g., `student.py`, `teacher.py`, `gradebook.py`, `course_manager.py`).
- Designed to be run from the command line with Python 3.9+.

## Getting Started
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Install any dependencies if present (none required for core usage).
3. Run the simulation entry script (for example):
   ```bash
   python course_manager.py
   ```

## Notes
- This repository is intended for learning and experimentation.
- Structure and filenames may evolve as features are added.
